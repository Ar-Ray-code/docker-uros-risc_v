This repository contains docker-related material to setup, configure and develop
with [micro-ROS hardware](https://github.com/microROS/hardware). The idea behind
this respository is to simplify the development process with
micro-ROS by providing a unified environment based on a Linux container.

For installing docker, refer to https://www.docker.com/.
